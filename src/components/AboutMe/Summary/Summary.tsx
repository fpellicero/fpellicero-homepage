                        Passionate software developer, Javascript lover and team
                        player. I'm always looking for technical challenges, and I
                        value a team with strong bonds over anything else.

                    <p>
                        Big advocate of Keeping Things Simple, but I love to
                        over-engineer things in my free time to push my boundaries.
                        Trying to deliver the best quality software possible. Never
                        satisfied with the status-quo, I question things and try to
                        improve them constantly.
